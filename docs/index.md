# Welcome to foxOps

The intention of this project is to enable a gitOps approach to the configuration and management of GitLab repositories and instances. The project's philosophy is to leverage existing frameworks and libraries wherever possible, and to simplify configuration into a pull-diff-plan-push workflow. The tool will retain no state of its own, and will be a Python command-line tool.
